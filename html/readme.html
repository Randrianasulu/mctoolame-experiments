<h2>Introduction</h2>

mctooLAMEd is an  Mpeg 2 Layer 2 Multi-Channel audio DEcoder.  It is based heavily on 
<UL>
    <LI>the ISO dist10 code 
    <LI>toolame
    <LI>work by myself and other contributors (see CONTRIBUTORS)
</ul>
This release is alpha-ish. It should produce valid mpeg streams from 5-channel or 6-channel AIFF files.

<h2>History</h2>
See <a href="history.html">history</a>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<OL>
<LI> edit Makefile (at least change the architecture type [ARCH] to suit your machine)
<LI> 'make'
</ol>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<pre>
         ./mctoolamed [options] [input file] [output file]

Input File
        A layerII mpeg audio file. 

Input Options
        (run mctooLAMEd without args for a full list)

Output File
        Outputs: A multichannel AIFF file
                 A wav file for each channel (called left.wav, right.wav etc)

</pre>

<h2>Examples</h2>
Don't get too fancy for the time being.
<pre>
	mctoolamed sound.mp2
</pre>
If "sound.mp2" was a 5.1 mpeg audio file, you should get a "sound.aiff" as well as 
"left.wav", "right.wav", "centre.wav", "lfe.wav", "left_surround.wav", "right_surround.wav".<p>
The WAVE file support was hacked in for my sanity (since I don't have anything to directly play 
multi-channel AIFFs), and only works properly for 44.1kHz.

<h2>To Do</h2>
<UL>
<LI> Fix audio output handling.
<LI> Add support for more common audio file outputs? multi-channel wave?
</UL>

<h2>Contributors</h2>

<UL>
<LI> Mainly just me.
